lms with retrieval of relevant knowledge decreases such issues however indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number of retrieved passages regardless of whether retrieval is necessary or passages are relevant diminishes lm versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation we introduce a new framework called selfreflective retrievalaugmented gen eration  selfragthat enhances an lms quality and factuality through retrieval and selfreflection our framework trains a single arbitrary lm that adaptively retrieves passages ondemand and generates and reflects on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens called reflection tokens generating reflection tokens makes the lm controllable during the inference phase enabling it to tailor its behavior to

knowledgeintensive tasks ram et al 2023 asai et al 2023a however these methods may hinder the versatility of llms or introduce unnecessary or offtopic passages that lead to lowquality generations shi et al 2023 since they retrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful moreover the output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages gao et al 2023 since the models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages this work introduces selfreflective retrievalaugmented generation  selfragto improve an llms generation quality including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility via ondemand retrieval and selfreflection we train an arbitrary lm in an endtoend manner to learn to reflect on its own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special tokens ie reflection tokens  reflection tokens are categorized into retrieval andcritique tokens to indicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively figure 1 right in particular given an input prompt and preceding generations selfragfirst determines if augmenting the continued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful if so it outputs a retrieval token that calls a retriever model on demand step 1 subsequently selfragconcurrently processes multiple retrieved passages evaluating their relevance and then generating corresponding task outputs step 2 it then generates critique tokens to criticize its own output and choose best one step 3 in terms of

inc new york usanick craswell microsoft seattle usajimmy lin university of waterloo waterloo canada abstract did you try out the new bing search or maybe you fiddled around with google ai overviews these might sound familiar because the modernday search stack has recently evolved to include retrieval augmented generation rag systems they allow searching and incorporating realtime data into large language models llms to provide a wellinformed attributed concise summary in contrast to the traditional search paradigm that relies on displaying a ranked list of documents therefore given these recent advancements it is crucial to have an arena to build test visualize and systematically evaluate ragbased search systems with this in mind we propose the trec 2024 rag track to foster innovation in evaluating rag systems in our work we lay out the steps weve made towards making this track a reality  we describe the details of our reusable framework ragnarök explain the curation of the new ms marco v21 collection choice release the development topics for the track and standardize the io definitions which assist the end user next using ragnarök we identify and provide key industrial baselines such as openais gpt4o or coheres command r further we introduce a webbased user interface for an interactive arena allow ing benchmarking pairwise rag systems by crowdsourcing we opensource our ragnarök framework and baselines to achieve a unified standard for future rag systems httpsgithubcomcastoriniragnarok 1 introduction retrieval augmented generation rag  10212229 has emerged as a popular technique to augment large language model llm gen eration for knowledgeintensive tasks such as opendomain ques tion answering or fact verification  44 using the top 𝑘retrieved segments from a suitable retrieval system rag systems output an answer summary grounded on the relevant context rag systems mitigate factual inconsistencies in llm outputs  19262934 and enhance interpretability  21 and generalization  20 thus facilitat ing a wider adoption across several domains like medicine  55 and finance 23 several companies provide endtoend rag frameworks such as bing search  39 or google gemini  5 most of these systems are either proprietary or offer limited user customization likewise the absence of a standardized rag framework makes implementing both authors contributed equally to the paper correspondence to ronak pradeep rpradeepuwaterlooca and nandan thakur nandanthakuruwaterloocarag at a large scale challenging implementing atop existing frame works requires custom code for multiple steps including retrieval reranking and generation to promote wider adoption of rag in academia we develop ragnarök a userfriendly reusable end toend rag framework offering code for customizable retrievers rerankers and generation models ragnarök comprises two key modules r retrieval and ag augmented generation the retrieval module incorporates both the retrieval and reranking stages to yield the top 𝑘retrieved seg ments for an input user topic next the augmented generation module uses the userprovided topic and retrieved segments to produce an rag answer formatted into individual sentences cit ing the relevant information from the top 𝑘retrieved segments ragnarök is deeply integrated with existing python frameworks such as pyserini 31 and rank_llm 4647 and can be easily in stalled via pypi using  pip install pyragnarok  the framework offers easytouse rest apis and an integrated webui to enhance userfriendliness and improve the human evaluation experience the ragnarök framework will be used for providing baselines in the upcoming trec 2024 retrieval augmented generation rag track1an ideal framework should include a sufficiently large doc ument collection covering diverse information and nonfactoid decompositional topics requiring longform answers in our frame work we deduplicate the existing ms marco v2 document col lection in addition we provide a segment collection using a slidingwindow chunking technique discussed in section 4 fur ther we release two sets of development topics i trecraggy 2024 a filtered subset of topics with longform answers from trec deep learning 202123  1517 and ii trecresearchy 2024 a subset of the researchy questions introduced in rosset et al 51 our ragnarök framework supports a headtohead rag battle arena for the answer evaluation heavily inspired by recent work such as the chatbot arena  1358 we include key industrial base lines such as cohere command r  14 and openai gpt4o  41 and evaluate both the baselines using the retrieval setup involving bm25  49 and rankzephyr  47 with human preferences overall we observe gpt4o to provide more detailed answers over com mand r on the development set of topics discussed in section 6 finally we opensource ragnarök and make it publicly available at the following url httpsgithubcomcastoriniragnarok in the future we will include a wider variety of llms as

earlier used in the trec dl tracks contains a substantial overlap of nearduplicates docu ments with sufficiently similar text information within the collec tion  1617 when left intact these nearduplicates degrade the downstream retrieval accuracy and reduce the diversity of the col lected documents potentially impacting the effectiveness of rag systems in addition chunking which breaks down a long verbose document into smaller compact representations is a key challenge in rag as the retrieved chunk representations correlate with the rag answer quality 34 ms marco v21 document collection we conduct a deduplica tion strategy in the ms marco v2 document collection to avoid nearduplicates in two stages in the first stage we establish an equivalence class of the documents using locality sensitive hashing lsh with minhash  11 and 9gram shingles next we selected a representative document for each equivalence class for our refined ms marco v21 document collection2reducing the duplicates in the original ms marco v2 document collection by 835 as shown in table 1 ms marco v21 segment collection we segment the ms marco v21 document collection into overlapping segments or chunks and develop the ms marco v21 segment collection3with more than 113 million text segments table 1 we utilize a sliding window technique to generate the segments by fixing the sliding window size of 10 sentences and a stride of 5 sentences to create each seg ment roughly on average between 5001000 characters long to easily map each segment back to the document every segment contains the document id within the segment id further two new fields start_char andend_char indicate the start and the end position character of where the segment begins and ends in the mapped ms marco v21 document collection 5 topic collection topics ie user queries are crucial for robust evaluation of rag systems traditionally popular retrieval and traditional qa bench marks primarily consist of factoid queries where answers are typi cally found within a single sentence or paragraph however these topics lack complexity leading to short answers that can be easily memorized by llms for instance ms marco  8 surprisingly con tains up to 55 factoid queries  951 to avoid shortform answers in rag we utilize two collections containing nonfactoid topics covering information about diverse topics and requiring longform answers we describe these collections below 2ms marco v21 document collection msmarco_v21_doctar 3ms marco v21 segment collection msmarco_v21_doc_segmentedtartable 2 trecraggy and

develop trecraggy 2024 a collection with topics filtered from trec deep learning 20212023 tracks  15 17 based on topic category and generatedanswer classification we classify each available topic into seven categories described in appendix a and filter out a subset of topics that either have a long form answer or require information aggregation across multiple sources of information out of the 210 original topics available we filter and include 120 topics 571 in the trecraggy 2024 topic collection4from table 2 we observe 242 of the topics included are aggregation indicating rag systems require to aggregate information from multiple retrieved segments to generate an accu rate longform answer similarly 65 of the topics start with what or how overall a majority of the topics are useful for evaluation containing diverse topic categories requiring a longform answer trecresearchy 2024 researchy questions introduced in ros set et al  51  contains 102k nonfactoid topics with longform answers these topics were curated from bing search logs and eval uated by gpt4 on a scale of 010 based on eight intrinsic attributes such as subjectivity and multifacetedness definitions provided in appendix b notably unlike trecraggy 2024 these queries lack relevance judgments to curate a smaller development subset for a faster evaluation of rag systems we employ a sampler designed to maximize diversity based on the eight intrinsic attributes this is achieved by iteratively selecting the query with the highest 𝑙1 norm in the intrinsic attribute space of all eight dimensions rela tive to the alreadysampled set the resultant topic set we dub as trecresearchy 20245from table 2 about 80 of the topics are knowledgeintensive and about 76 are multifaceted highlighting the need for effective rag systems additionally 665 of topics start with how or why emphasizing explanatory questions these distributions suggest that trecresearchy 2024 prioritizes complex and multidimensional topics 6 trec

developed for complex rag pipelines  14 ii gpt4o is the latest gpt version from ope nai  41 given that command r cites in a span level we map the citations to their parent sentences for gpt4o we follow the zeroshot chatqa prompt template  35 and cite relevant segments within the text inline using the ieee format an example of the prompt template is shown in figure 2 in the appendix ragbench evaluation evaluating different rag answers is chal lenging as multiple factors within the output response are crucial for effectiveness evaluation to combat this recent works rely on an llmasajudge setup  58 where strong llm assessors judge the raggenerated output in a pairwise evaluation style sidebyside in a headon tournament in our work we briefly overview our baseline techniques using human evaluators a complete illustra tion can be found in table 4 in the appendix the command r baseline outputs shorter answers and cites more relevant segments whereas the gpt4o baseline outputs longer and more detailed answers and cites fewer segments therefore for topics in both trecraggy and trecresearchy 2024 gpt4o intuitively is the better choice for rag answer generation we leave it for future work to empirically compute the win rates in  between our baselines in the ragbench evaluation 61 ragnarök system arena heavily inspired by the success of chatbot arena  1358 a crowd sourcing benchmark webui featuring anonymous battles we ex tend the concept to multistage configurable rag pipelines with ragnarök in the arena users interact with two unblindedblinded rag systems simultaneously issuing the same topic to both the participants evaluate and select the pipeline that delivers their most preferred response with the identities of the modules in the endto end pipeline revealed after the voting process in the blinded case we leverage gradio  1 to build the webui for ragnarök each step of the pipeline uses rest apis for intercommunication enabling easy module switching within the pipeline this modular design simplifies the integration of different retrieval and llm configura tions enhancing scalability and maintainability figure 3 in the appendix illustrates an example topic what inspired pink floyds the wall processed by two different pipelines pipeline a comprising bm25 rankzephyrgpt4o left and pipeline b comprising bm25 rankgpt4ocommand r right in the unblinded tab the outputs generated by each pipeline are compared allowing users to discern which system provided a more satisfactory answer note that when the user hovers the mouse over a citation they can preview the cited segment further in appendix c we discuss the blinded pairwise evaluation and the responses json output tab available in the webui for ragnarök7 ongoing work ragnarök is the first step for the ongoing work in the trec 2024 rag track by releasing the document collections development topics and baseline strategies for participants we will continue to update the pipelines to include more diverse retrieval models including stateoftheart dual encoders such as articembed  38 and effective pointwisepairwise rerankers  45 we plan to add additional support for more advanced rag techniques like self rag  7 and crag  56 for the trec 2024 rag track test topics we plan to conduct a new and fresh scrape of the bing search logs closer to the submission period this approach will compile a fresh and recent set of topics similar to rosset et al  51  thereby mini mizing the risk of data leakage and ensuring a fair evaluation with existing commercially available llms the next phase of our efforts will focus on finalizing the eval uation methodology using an automatic nuggetbased evaluation following earlier work in lin and demnerfushman 30 and first discussed in the trec rag 2024 presentation deck6the nugget based evaluation is recently gaining popularity  263748 and is becoming the de facto strategy for rag evaluation 8 conclusion the emergence

       "'Self-RAG, or Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a framework that aims to enhance the quality and factuality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieval of relevant knowledge and self-reflection during the generation process. This approach allows the model to adaptively retrieve passages on-demand and reflect on both the retrieved information and its own generated content using special tokens called reflection tokens. An example application of Self-RAG could be in open-domain question answering, where it dynamically retrieves information to generate accurate and coherent responses. However, a potential challenge of Self-RAG is the complexity of training and fine-tuning the model to balance retrieval, generation, and self-reflection processes, as well as ensuring the quality and relevance of retrieved passages for real-world applications. Despite these challenges, Self-RAG holds promise for enhancing various knowledge-intensive tasks like fact verification, reasoning, and long-form content generation, thereby improving the overall performance and reliability of AI systems.'"
